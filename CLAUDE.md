## Git Commits

**NEVER add Co-Authored-By lines to commits.** All commits should be attributed solely to the repository owner. Do not include any AI attribution in commit messages.

## Code Style

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Dark theme colors: `bg-[#1e1e1e]`, `bg-[#2d2d2d]`, `border-[#3d3d3d]`
